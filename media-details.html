                    <p>I am quite bullish on AI developments. Particularly from the likes of OpenAI.</p>
                    <p>OpenAI has just announced a series of advancements set to significantly reshape how entrepreneurs interact with ChatGPT.</p>
                    <p>They have made it easier for non-coders to build their own customized chatbots - called GPTs to be more helpful in tasks at work or at home.</p>
                    <p>For example, you could create a GPT that helps you analyze your workouts better or one that generates new cocktail recipes tailored to your favorite alcohol considering the season and fresh fruit available as well as one for helping you come up with funny limericks to entertain your teenage kids.</p>
                    <p>OpenAI gives the power to its users to build their own tools to solve their problems.</p>
                    <p>This significant development heralds challenging times ahead for numerous Indiehackers and small AI startups, especially those that function primarily as a simple layer on top of OpenAI's API.</p>
                    <p>Businesses offering niche services such as "Chat with your PDFs" or "Chat with your Documents" could find themselves on the brink of obsolescence, given that OpenAI's new capabilities could potentially commoditize these offerings. As it now allows for adding your own knowledge to build a GPT as well.</p>
                    <p>In the rapidly evolving AI industry, it's imperative to not only adapt to change, but also to anticipate it.</p>
                    <p>Imagine a world where Web3 gaming companies can use it to create their own style of art aided by a GPT. This could lead to a more immersive and narrative driven experience for clients.</p>
                    <p>E-commerce companies can deepen their engagement with customers by using chatbots which recommend products based on the client’s buying history.</p>
                    <p>As strategic business advisors, we offer proactive guidance, helping you to identify potential risks, like over-reliance on solving only one problem, and encouraging adaptability in your AI strategy.</p>
                    <p>Working with Asia SGE means you're not just reacting to change – you're staying ahead of it. This strategy expands your capabilities, bolsters your value proposition, and paves the way for a diversified, resilient strategy. AI or otherwise.</p>
                    <p>In an era of rapid change, it's crucial for businesses to expand their scope. We'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments section. How do you ensure resilience and perpetual growth in such a dynamic business environment?</p>

                    <p>Nov 7</p></br>
                    <p>This is a growth analogy. Tune in. </p>
                    <p>The dramatic narrative of WeWork, once valued at an impressive $47 billion and now nearing bankruptcy, brings to my mind a fascinating analogy. It reminds me of the contrast between Old Growth Forests and New Growth Forests.</p>
                    <p>Old Growth Forests are trees which have matured over centuries without significant human interference.</p>
                    <p>The dense rings within these trees serve as evidence of their fight for limited resources, symbolizing resilience.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, New Growth Forests, essentially tree farms, have been nurtured with ample resources. Despite their outward strength, these trees bear less dense rings, hinting at an inherent fragility.</p>
                    <p>Now as the business climate transitions towards high-interest rates and scarce funding, we can see the rise of 'old growth' businesses. Drawing strength from adversity, these enterprises grow steadily, much like Old Growth Trees.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, 'new growth' businesses, which previously thrived in a resource-rich environment, may grapple with new challenges in the current economic climate.</p>
                    <p>This shift, while demanding, could lead to a robust business ecosystem overall.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, it comes down to founders recognizing and adapting to shifting dynamics. As the environment evolves, businesses need to pivot, adopting more 'old-growth' characteristics to ensure a balanced approach to sustained success.</p>
                    <p>At Asia SGE, our aim is to assist founders to build a sustainable business which enriches all stakeholders. By understanding and implementing more 'old growth' strategies we can build resilient start-ups and ecosystems which are able to adapt as the climate evolves.</p>
                    <p>Let's explore this further – are there any changes you have made to adapt to the evolving business landscape?</p>

                    <p>Nov 1</p></br>
                    <p>Hong Kong’s adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and tokenization is transforming the city’s financial industry landscape for the better.</p>
                    <p>I was recently chatting with colleagues about how Hong Kong has a knack for adopting technologies which brings about improvements from the way things have been done before.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps it is something that is in the city’s DNA that makes it a trailblazer,</p>
                    <p>For instance, the HKMA along with the Hong Kong SAR government are planning to issue another round of tokenised bonds.</p>
                    <p>The first round was in February 2023 where tokenized notes worth HK$800 million were issued. According to a HKMA report, using DLT brought about improvements via reducing manual processing and lowering servicing time and costs in the institutional bond issuance process.</p>
                    <p>Tokenization converts the investors rights in the notes to a digital token which is recorded on a blockchain. This allows the asset to be fractionalised (broken up) making it more accessible to individual investors and boosts liquidity.</p>
                    <p>In the future tokenization could be used to incorporate real-time tracking and reporting features which would be valuable for environmental, social, and governance issuances.</p>
                    <p>Seeing Hong Kong be an innovator in this space, reaffirms my belief in the city. It’s adoption and implementation of innovative technologies will enable Hong Kong based entrepreneurs to take the lead to develop products which can cater to a global audience.</p>
                    <p>We at Asia SGE are proud to be headquartered in such a vibrant city that is taking Web3 seriously and paving the way for others to follow.</p>

                    <p>Oct 30</p></br>
                    <p>Many startup founders are rethinking their path to profitability, as the era of easy money is gone.</p>
                    <p>This will be uphill struggle, as problems such as these are complex and there is no one solution/strategy which will solve all problems. The best way to find answers is to look at leaders in our field who have faced such problems and overcome them.</p>
                    <p>As a strategist, I worked with multiple founders during the pandemic, the ones who have endured the hardships and led their teams to success have one key virtue- Patience.</p>
                    <p>They are doers who invest time and resources in understanding their clients pain points and form long-term actionable strategies guiding the company towards success. These adaptive leaders act with conviction and can pivot when others can't.</p>
                    <p>Their ability to think deeply becomes their trump card during challenging times.</p>
                    <p>Consider Howard Schultz of Starbucks - his vision transcended beyond selling coffee; he aimed to create a 'third place' between work and home where people could unwind yet feel welcomed and be a part of a community. This broader insight explains why Starbucks stood out from its competition.</p>
                    <p>At Asia SGE, we look for this thoughtful approach. We concentrate on the hurdles startups (or Venture Capital firms with portfolio companies) face when launching or scaling up, enabling us to identify multiple potential solutions for our clients.</p>
                    <p>In these unpredictable times, the patience to look at problems and peel back the layers one by one is what sets winners apart.</p>

          details: `
                    <p>Oct 27</p></br>
                    <p>Have you ever wondered if Hedge Fund Managers are closet gamblers?</p>
                    <p>Well, the story behind the origins of hedge funds might just surprise you then.</p>
                    <p>The first hedge fund was built using the sophisticated techniques used by seasoned gamblers to hedge their bets.</p>
                    <p>The first hedge fund was built by the American investment manager Alfred Winslow Jones. He referred to his firm as a ‘hedged fund’. Indicating that he had set limits on his bets to protect his downside.</p>
                    <p>Jones’s key insight was that a fund manager could combine two techniques: buying stocks with leverage and selling short other stocks. While each technique was considered risky and highly speculative, their combination would result in a conservative portfolio from a risk perspective.</p>
                    <p>The expectation was that it would outperform the markets and deliver outsized returns while mitigating risk.</p>
                    <p>When faced with the dilemma of how he should be paid for his efforts, he took inspiration from ancient Phoenician Sea captains, who would pay themselves 20% of the profit from a successful voyage.</p>
                    <p>These methods were so successful that they are still used by hedge funds today.</p>
                    <p>I find this story fascinating because Jones showed creativity by being able to take ideas from gamblers and sea captains and applying them to traditional asset management.</p>
                    <p>This ingenuity is becoming increasingly relevant as we witness the birth of multiple new markets over the past decade, ranging from crypto to AI.</p>
                    <p>Designing services in these new markets needs deep understanding of the markets as well as inspiration from other sources.</p>
                    <p>For example, devising the economics behind crypto token could benefit from experiences in more traditional financial markets such as capital raising and book running for equity IPO’s.</p>
                    <p>With the wide experience of me and my colleagues at Asia SGE we are confident that the insights we have gathered over the years guiding startups and founders can be applied to the emerging crypto space, and with the right creativity other industries as well.</p>

                    <p>In today’s online world, we often feel like we must share all our wins. It's like the age-old saying: If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?</p>
                    <p>Put in a different way, if we achieve something and nobody knows, does it still count?</p>
                    <p>A recent post from Dr. Julie Gurner made me stop and think about this. Her post helped me reflect that real success isn't measured by the praise a person receives or being in the spotlight.</p>
                    <p>Instead, it's about being able to step back from the noise, focusing on our work, completing the next task/project, and going on to the next and keep going, even when there's no crowd cheering us on.</p>
                    <p>Being driven is a superpower.</p>
                    <p>When I thought about this, I noticed that this characteristic is present in our most resilient and successful clients at Asia SGE. These are entrepreneurs who might not always be in the public eye, but they keep moving forward, making progress even without a big audience cheering them on.</p>
                    <p>This reminds me of famous filmmakers like James Cameron and Christopher Nolan. We don't hear about them every day, do we? But when they release a new movie, we can see how many hours they've spent working hard behind the scenes creating something truly special.</p>
                    <p>At Asia SGE, we want to be there for these committed individuals, to give them the support they need when they need it most, and to help lighten their load so they can focus on what they do best: building, innovating, and growing their businesses.</p>

                    <p>Dear founders, how do you treat your success metrics?</p>
                    <p>Metrics can either solidify the business narrative or derail a founder’s vision.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my journey, I've noticed startups in Tech, crypto, and beyond leveraging metrics such as AUM growth or burgeoning token values to fuel employee and investor enthusiasm, even when the revenue barely covers operating costs.</p>
                    <p>This is because it’s easier to digest data that drives a narrative forward, such as increasing number of sign ups, website traffic, no of clicks – while forgetting what matters to the #business.</p>
                    <p>Do it too often and founders eventually get caught up in their own bubble.</p>
                    <p>We saw a similar scenario unfold during the dot-com bubble. Companies promised extraordinary growth and secured funding without verifying product market demand, prioritizing storytelling over business fundamentals. Surging stock prices sparked an investment frenzy, but when reality set in, the bubble—and many cash-strapped dotcom companies—collapsed, taking investors' funds with them.</p>
                    <p>My team and I have experienced the ever-changing startup landscape, staying vigilant to the decisions and metrics followed in a booming market do not necessarily work in a depressed market.</p>
                    <p>Considering the lessons we've learned over the past few years, which metric would you prioritize today?</p>

                    <p>One of my criteria before starting a project is: Can this venture achieve exponential growth?</p>
                    <p>Let me explain why I value this so much by sharing one of my favourite stories about the sale of Manhattan in 1626.</p>
                    <p>Peter Minuit led the purchase of real estate in Manhattan from the Native Americans and paid them $24 in beads and trinkets. This might seem like a bad trade, even a swindle. However, Peter Lynch in his book ‘One Up on Wall Street’, conducted a thought experiment; What if the Natives invested $24 in 1626 at 8% interest rate per year, what would it be worth today?</p>
                    <p>In 1988, when the book was published the investment would have grown to an astounding $30 trillion.</p>
                    <p>This is why I apply the concept of compounding not just to finances, but to the relationships and networks I build every day. I am always trying to grow the relationships I’ve built and look for ways my connections can interact with each other and create exponential success.</p> 
                    <p>It’s possible for me to build these relationships partly due to the effort and presence of institutions such as the FinTech Association of Hong Kong and organizations like Hult Alumni Association and Building relationships is one of the most rewarding aspects of my professional life, and I am so grateful that I can do what I love every day.</p>
                    <p>But what about you? How have the relationships you’ve built impacted your career or business?</p>

                    <p>You all know that Artificial Intelligence is a powerhouse at many tasks. Yet, as you're going to find out, it's not quite adept in the stock-picking arena.</p>
                    <p>Wall Street Journal reports that AI-driven exchange-traded funds have missed out on capturing returns from the tech-fueled market rally and are lagging the S&P 500.</p>
                    <p>The problem? These models rely heavily on historical data but struggle to grasp a dynamic fast-changing landscape. Take Meta, for example. AI models believed that Meta was overvalued and hence did not recommend purchasing its stock. But with Meta’s shares skyrocketing over 140% since December, it's clear that AI missed the bullish wave to come.</p>
                    <p>This underlines why we must scrutinize the drivers behind AI models more intently. Many of these models appear vulnerable to the 'normalcy bias’- the presumption that the future will mirror the past.</p>
                    <p>Humans often let emotions sway their investment decisions, succumbing to the latest hype or panic. AI models, devoid of emotion, don't overreact - or so we think. Yet, markets are sentiment-fueled; volatility can lead to losses or gains. AI tends to inherit and propagate the beliefs embedded in the data it trains on, coupled with full decision-making power, the risks get even higher.</p>
                    <p>As Andrew Ng suggests, AI should be seen as a tool, not the boss. It's there to inform our decisions, not to make them entirely. As well, in this perspective, it will probably not create an apocalyptic event as some might argue.</p>
                    <p>We at Asia SGE have seen the same issues plaguing our clients, primarily startups, when they become overly data centric. We've seen startups steadfastly follow data, oblivious to user feedback. Data should act as a beacon, not the sole compass for decisions.</p>

                    <p>Since ancient times, knowledge has been power.</p>
                    <p>Consider this example from ancient Egypt, where the harvest hinged upon the flooding of the Nile. The level of flooding was intertwined with all aspects of life, including how prosperous the farmers would be in the next season. The priests who would predict the floods were revered for their ability and held significant power.</p>
                    <p>Not known to the public, the priests and the ruling elite had an ace up their sleeve - a structure called a Nilometer, which allowed them to measure the level of the flood each year.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the Nilometer, the ruling class had accurate records of flood patterns dating back centuries which aided in accurate predictions. They wielded the information provided by the Nilometer to further their power.</p>
                    <p>Fast-forward to today, we have countless tools available at our fingertips. The ability to choose and utilize the right tool is a skill in itself.</p>
                    <p>The right tools are usually found by those who are driven by curiosity, willing to experiment, learn by rolling the sleeves and do the hard work.</p>
                    <p>In my role at Asia SGE, part of my responsibility is to spot these talented individuals. Especially those that exhibit a unique blend of curiosity mixed with a ‘let-me-try- this-and-see-if-it-works’ attitude. I believe these are qualities of a talented team player, one that is ‘rain making’ while supporting the rest of the team.</p>
                    <p>Startup founders often request me to share my network and introduce them to the right person for a particular job, or we would actively do this while working alongside them towards important milestones. When making these introductions, I prioritize those who I feel have the skill of using the right tool at the right time.</p>
                    <p>What do you consider when connecting one person to another? And how do you spot the right person?</p>

                    <p>As a strategic advisor to entrepreneurs, I welcome the initiatives proposed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) aimed at fostering FinTech initiatives across Wealthtech/Investech, Insurtech, Greentech, Artificial Intelligence, and Distributed Ledger Technology. These are steps in the right direction.</p>
                    <p>The HKMA’s vision as outlined in their whitepaper is “To bolster Hong Kong’s position as a leading global financial centre that offers world-class digitally enabled products, services and experiences to all consumers and businesses through fully embracing Fintech solutions, facilitated by active cross-sectoral collaboration.”</p>
                    <p>The goal is to harness the power of Fintech innovation to bridge the gap between tech providers and institutions. The outcome of which would create value for all parties involved. It will lead to greater convenience for Hong Konger’s in the form of personalised, faster, more intuitive experiences, improved security, expanded product offerings and lower costs.
                       The proposed initiatives include,</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Evolving the existing Regtech Knowledge Hub into a comprehensive Fintech Knowledge Hub, with well-curated fintech content. The hub will also feature a contact directory, fostering connectivity among fintech users and solution providers</li>
                      <li>Detailed videos that highlight successful real-life use cases</li>
                      <li>Fintech showcase events, accompanied by roundtable discussions</li>
                      <li>Best practice guides</li>
                      <li>Research reports</li>
                      <li>Webinars / seminars and training sessions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's commendable to witness HKMA proactively rallying support from regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Futures Commission and the Insurance Authority to foster adoption. However, for tangible change and progress to occur, these initiatives must be backed by substantial investments in programs that drive them.</p>
                    <p>Hong Kong's rich tradition of industry investment, when necessary, must persist for it to remain competitive in an increasingly digital world.</p>

                    <p>Hindenburg Research has again and again exposed that is not the case.</p>
                    <p>Take the case of Tingo Group Inc, listed on the NASDAQ, worth $3 billion at its peak. The individuals running the company conned investors into believing it is an agricultural behemoth operating in Nigeria.</p>
                    <p>Tingo used stock photos of farmers using “their” mobile phone devices on their website. The company photoshopped its logo on pictures of airlines encouraging customers to “Fly With Tingo Airlines Today”.</p>
                    <p>The founder Dozy Mmobuosi’s history is chequered with red flags from lying about his academic achievements to being arrested for issuing bad checks of $70,000.</p>
                    <p>Tingo’s modus operandi is to claim mysterious relationships with farmers co-operatives, mobile phone device suppliers and banks to perpetuate its image of a goliath. They even used creative accounting to show incredible operating margins while simultaneously making basic calculation errors- in one place they forgot to add 3 zeroes and misspelled its own name.</p>
                    <p>Despite so many red flags Tingo’s auditors issued a clean audit opinion.</p>

          details: `
                    <p>Jun 30</p></br> 
                    <p>With all the recent talk about the talent squeeze in Hong Kong, people keep forgetting that Hong Kong has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the developed world. So, we wondered if there is a relationship between Hong Kong's unemployment rate and the city’s dire talent shortage.</p>
                    <p>Hong Kong has one of the highest unemployment rates in developed economies, currently just under 4%. This includes an unemployment rate of over 10% for those aged 15 to 24. At the same time, Hong Kong businesses are complaining about a serious talent shortage and inability to find qualified workers. This is known as a "talent squeeze". Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce surveyed 196 companies in April with 74% suffering from talent shortage and apparently for more than a year.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the unemployment rate only accounts for those actively seeking work and registered as jobless. It does not include discouraged workers who have given up looking for jobs. This vastly neglects Hong Kong's unemployed youth that likely do not have the in-demand skills and experience that companies are seeking. There appears to be a mismatch between the type of talent available and what businesses need.</p>
                    <p>Some argue that Hong Kong's education system may not be adequately preparing students for the job market, resulting in high graduate unemployment suggesting a shortage of certain key skills. Especially emphasizing the focus on “acing” exams yet overlooking essential soft skills that are key to the demanding and aggressive business culture in Hong Kong, and the region.</p>
                    <p>The last factor is of course the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted business operations, accelerated automation, and changed skill requirements - further straining the supply of qualified talent relative to demand. COVID and other political influences drove many of the expatriates away, alongside major companies, leaving an immense gap in the market. Furthermore, it boosted WFH policies and put stronger emphasis on management skills that seems to be lacking.</p>
                    <p>Even though the question about the relationship has been answered broadly, there is no bright light in the horizon for time being. Recovery in these aspects is unclear. This is due to a mix of reasons resulting from not only pandemic and politics, but as well the very fabric of education and skilling/reskilling the workforce. It’s a complex combination of educational, demographic, immigration and economic factors that appear to be driving both the unemployment problem and talent squeeze.</p>
                    <p>At Asia SGE we help fill these gaps. Predominantly through advisory work and restructuring, but also in filling essential gaps in the fields of operations, finance, and other administrative capacities allowing our clients to focus on driving their business forward.</p>

                    <p>Currency for All: Will Worldcoin Truly Be Money for the Masses?</p>
                    <p>If you haven’t heard, the creator behind ChatGPT is taking on the world of crypto</p>
                    <p>Worldcoin is a billion-dollar startup co-founded by Sam Altman - of OpenAI fame. The startup’s plan is to give its token for free in exchange for scanning a user’s iris. It hopes to use this method to rapidly expand around the world and build up its database of users.</p>
                    <p>The venture has succeeded in raising money from the who’s who of Silicon Valley ranging from Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures and Tiger Global.</p>
                    <p>Worldcoin is trying to solve for “proof of personhood”. That is establishing that an entity is a unique person by scanning the user’s iris to verify their identity. This is to ensure that that user is not a bot.</p>
                    <p>The technology being deployed for the iris scan is the Worldcoin orb. It’s a shiny, chrome-surfaced, melon-sized sphere which can take a detailed picture of a person’s iris in a matter of seconds.
                        Once the scan is complete, the individual is added to a database of verified humans, and Worldcoin creates a unique cryptographic hash or equation that’s tied to that person. The scan isn’t saved, but the hash can be used in the future to prove the person’s identity anonymously.</p>
                    <p>The company has a three-part mission — to create a global ID linked to the scan, a global currency and an app that enables payment, purchases and transfers using its own token, along with other digital assets and traditional currencies. A global currency that could for example, help people send money to their families overseas without paying middlemen or wire fees.</p>     
                    <p>The project has the lofty goal of building an inclusive financial network as a global public utility. The aim is to deliver benefits, such as future currency drops as part of universal basic income programs which could help in offsetting job losses caused by AI.</p>
                    <p>However, it’s not all smooth sailing, the project has seen its share of negative coverage with privacy experts raising alarm bells over a crypto project having access to people’s biometric data.</p>
                    <p>With newfangled crypto projects coming and going and buzzwords such as inclusivity being thrown around, it remains to be seen whether Worldcoin has learned from the criticism of other moonshot projects such as Facebook’s Libra.</p>
                    <p>Will this be a pathbreaking technology which will lead humanity to a more equal society or just another disastrous project which could leak the biometric data of millions?</p>

                    <p>Will Asia emerge as the world leader in AI Innovation?</p>
                    <p>While the West has spearheaded AI development for years, Asia is rapidly gaining ground and could surpass the West in AI innovation and commercial adoption.</p>
                    <p>There are key trends indicating that Asia is positioned to become the new AI leader. Some of these trends might be up for discussion, but there are strong reasons behind each of them.</p>
                    <p>First is the massive Government Investment - China alone plans to invest over $150 billion in AI and related technologies by 2030, while other Asian countries are also investing heavily. This far outstrips AI funding in the West.</p>
                    <p>Then, there are the large Tech Companies - Asian tech giants like Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu and GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple) have massive data assets, money and AI talent in the region dedicated for AI optimization and breakthroughs.  </p>
                    <p>Data - The huge populations and rapid digitization of activities in Asia provide a massive amount of data for training AI systems, from user behaviour to financial transactions to images and video.  
                      Lower Regulatory Hurdles - Regulators in Asia have generally taken a more hands-off approach to AI, allowing for faster development and adoption compared to Europe's GDPR and other strict regulations. China is being somewhat reserved in allowing the mass deployment of these tools but broadly keeping abreast of developments and potential usages.</p>
                    <p>Low Labor Costs - Cheaper labor costs in Asia allow companies to build large AI teams at a lower expense to drive innovation. This is sparking an "AI arms race" in the region.</p>
                    <p>While skepticism and caution around some aspects of AI's development and impact are warranted, we should also recognize that Asia's emergence as an AI powerhouse may transform the global AI landscape in the coming decade. Asian companies and researchers will likely play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping how AI impacts our lives and work going forward. This all might seem controversial to begin with, but broadly this set of facts are definitely shaping to be the foundation for another east versus west front.</p>

                    <p>Launched in mid- April 2023, $PEPE’s market capitalization skyrocketed to $1.61 billion within weeks of its launch.</p>
                    <p>The memecoin is based on “Pepe the Frog” meme and the supply of PEPE tokens is upwards of 420 trillion, a reference to cannabis culture’s “4/20.”</p>
                    <p>Memecoins in recent history have drawn both investor attention and eyerolls over a perceived lack of seriousness. But the potential for risk takers to score big with memecoins is real, nonetheless.</p>
                    <p>Pepecoin garnered attention after an investor swapped 0.125 ETH, worth about $250, for a whopping 5.9 trillion PEPE tokens. As interest in the memecoin grew, the value of those tokens surged to about $1.02 million by April 19, 2023, yielding a potential return of roughly 4,000 times the initial investment within a span of a few days.</p>
                    <p>However, the investor who bought those 5.9 trillion tokens may have a difficult time selling them at the current price, given PEPE’s relatively low liquidity. Attempts to exit the entire position could lead to a crash in price.</p>
                    <p>This is why it’s important to be cautious when trading with coins that have spectacular returns as the market for them might be extremely shallow.</p>
                    <p>Currently the token’s price has dropped 66% since hitting an all-time high of $1.61 billion on May 6. It’s current market cap has fallen below $700 million. The top performing traders have increasingly been reducing their $PEPE holdings, a sign that the meme coin mania of the past weeks may be losing steam.</p>
                    <p>Speculative investments such as memecoins offer eye watering returns to early investors or founders of the project who have the ability to market the coin and generate interest around it. Once the euphoria dies investors late to the party who entered at the peak are faced with losses as the price enters a downward cycle.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to be cautious before entering into speculative cryptocurrency trades, given the possibility of the entire investment going to zero and not let fear of missing out drive investment decisions.</p>

                    <p>This erosion in reserve status has accelerated since the start of the Ukraine war. Sanctions on Russia such as freezing Russian central bank assets, incentivized large reserve-holding countries - mostly from the Global South - to reduce their USD holdings.</p>
                    <p>This fragmentation of the financial system got countries renegotiating the currency in which they get paid for trade. While war rages on, trade with Russia for some countries like India and China continues through alternate channels.</p>
                    <p>“Wars also upend the dominance of currencies and serve as a doula to the birth of new monetary systems,” says Zoltan Pozsar, analyst at Credit Suisse.</p>
                    <p>The main beneficiaries of USD market share drop have been the Yen and Euro — whose price-adjusted reserve market share surged 5% in 2022. But don’t sound the death knell on the USD just yet</p>   
                    <p>There are two pillars that make the USD mighty:</br>                  
                       1. Its role as the reserve currency of choice</br>                    
                       2. The dominant use in global finance/trade</p>
                    <p>As most cross border trades are completed in USD, it reinforces USD’s role as reserve currency of choice. Countries stash their rainy-day money in a currency in which they can buy/borrow, and stable.</p>                    
                    <p>Currently, no market has the breath to challenge the USD. But that could change in a couple of decades.</p>
                    <p>With the RMB, yen or euro, financial markets growing and offering stability, they could slowly but steadily overshadowing the US market.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that countries build a multi-currency reserve system where the dollar is playing an equal role to the RMB, dollar, yen or euro. Then, shocks originating from the US will have less of an impact on another countries economy as they would have been holding a basket of currencies in reserve.</p>
                    <p>For example, the current banking crises with the Fed hiking up interest rates, negatively affecting SVB finances which imploded as well as an increased crisis of confidence in Credit Suisse. In a world where there is a diversified basket of global reserve currencies this could have played out differently, authorities could have taken steps to insulate the Swiss bank from US policy.</p>
                    <p>That’s a big deal, especially for emerging markets because they will be able to focus more on what’s happening in their domestic economy and set policy according to domestic fundamentals. Then assets such as domestic equities will trade on domestic fundamentals and will be less responsive to the happenings in the US.</p>
                    <p>As investors it would make sense that we start hedging from today given that the world of FX will remain volatile for a while, and as some say the US dollar's dominance has peaked, the road is still long and turbulent.</p>

          details: `
                    <p>May 25</p></br> 
                    <p>When working with founders or vcs in the web3 space, my team and I are often asked if there are any ventures focusing on ESG and what they look like. </p>
                    <p>So, is there a connection or potential synergies between ESG and web3? </p>
                    <p>Of course, there is. It’s not a strong established relationship between the two just yet, but there is enough development in the market to say that it’s shaping up well.</p>
                    <p>ESG stands for environmental, social and governance, and refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment or company. There has been a growing focus on ESG in recent years from investors, corporations, and governments.</p>
                    <p>Web3 generally refers to a vision for the next phase of the internet that is decentralized, transparent and governed by community rather than large corporations. It encompasses technologies like blockchain, cryptocurrencies and decentralised apps.</p>
                    <p>Some argue that blockchain and cryptocurrencies have a large environmental footprint due to their energy usage. However, blockchain industry captains such as Dapper Labs, Rarible, Coinbase, Gemini, Algorand Foundation and others, are working relentlessly on mitigating this impact and building energy efficient solutions and upgrades. In addition, many believe web3 technologies could be harnessed to track supply chains, monitor pollution, and enable a more sustainable economy.</p>
                    <p>Here are some examples</p>
                    <p>Dapper Labs and Rarible are developing standards for disclosure of environmental impact NFT minting and tracking social impact for artists and creators. </p>
                    <p>Coinbase and Gemini are disclosing their own energy usage and carbon footprint and integrating ESG consideration into projects they list.</p>
                    <p>Algorand foundation is known for the stance it is taking for sustainability and energy efficiency. It’s creating partnerships to demonstrate how blockchains can support United Nations Sustainable Development goals.</p>
                    <p>Web3 advocates argue that decentralization could enable more inclusive participation, increased transparency and the creation of new economic and business models that better serve society. Although there are concerns that exist about web3's potential to increase economic inequalities, we believe that with individual ownership and global accessibility to internet, equality should improve.</p>
                    <p>For us at Asia SGE governance is an area of focus. The decentralized and community-driven nature of some web3 projects could align well with the "Governance" pillar of ESG. However, governance issues around transparency, accountability and ethics still exist within web3 and this seems unlikely to be resolved easily. Part of that is the bullish approach of large investment funds which fuel the development of web3 projects and until recently had very little by the way of ESG considerations.</p>
                    <p>There are opportunities to develop ESG reporting frameworks and metrics that are tailored for web3 companies and technologies. Blockdaemon does good work on this front. It developed an ESG reporting solution for blockchain networks that helps monitor and manage their footprint. This in turn helps offset those emissions and create stronger sustainability frameworks. Still, this is at an early stage, and we feel following this (and similar) developments is imperative. </p>
                    <p> We can only hope, for the sake of our planet and the future of humans that as focus on ESG continues to grow, web3 companies may increasingly look to demonstrate their own sustainability and ethical impact similar to other ESG leaders. We at Asia SGE frequently encourage clients and partners to explore ESG and help them develop a strategy. We recognize that for smaller newer companies this is something that seems too far from core business and often being postponed, but don’t be mistaken – investors and accelerators look for it. This is serious. Don’t be left behind.</p>

                    <p>Managing money can seem harder than earning it.</p>
                    <p>For many people earning their Wealth isn't what bothers them the most. Surprisingly, it's how to manage and monitor this wealth that ends up being a bigger hassle.</p>
                    <p>This occurs because the earning of wealth is a by-product of excelling at a craft or activity while getting paid for it on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p>It's part of the daily rhythm of our lives and something most high achievers wake up excited to do every day.</p>
                    <p>Once they have completed a task or project perhaps even earned their next promotion with a higher salary, most people forget that they now need to manage this wealth to make it grow for them.</p>
                    <p>Most people end up finding the thrill in the hunt much more exciting than the kill they see.</p>
                    <p>It doesn't help that managing wealth isn't easy and comes with its own set of challenges.</p>  
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <p>Assets can be bought on a whim but then need to be expertly managed</p>                  
                        <p>You might have bought a nice watch, attractive art or even a yacht to celebrate a professional milestone for yourself but all of these come with real world maintenance needs. Part of managing your wealth is choosing the best service providers for these at a cost that makes sense and isn't burning a whole in your pocket.</p>
                      </li>   
                      <li>
                        <p>Asset valuations change all the time and sometimes managing them means letting assets go</p>                  
                        <p>You might have parked some money in an asset which was recommended to you by someone but knowing that it's peaked and it's time to cash out is a critical aspect of managing your wealth.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Getting second opinions is critical to managing wealth</p>                  
                        <p>As human beings we often tend to believe the opinions of those close to us too much. It may or may not be the best idea to buy those vintage Air Jordans from an investment perspective regardless of how cool they look. Having a trusted adviser who can step in and help you get second opinions is another key aspect of managing your wealth properly.</p>

          details: `
                    <p>Apr 3</p></br>
                    <p>Great story to wrap up this intense week - Billionaire Gautam Adani has seen ~$60 billion wiped from his fortune.</p>
                    <p>Adani Group, is an Indian conglomerate which has lost upwards of $130 billion in market capitalization over the last couple of weeks after activist short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged fraud and stock price manipulation.</p>
                    <p>As per Hindenburg’s report, a lot of the public shareholders of Adani Group companies are offshore shell companies that are secretly affiliated with, and perhaps controlled, by Gautam Adani, the chairman and founder of Adani Group.</p>
                    <p>The accusation is - Adani is using these shell companies to pump up the stock price.</p>
                    <p>Can Gautam Adani save his business? The report lists serious allegations, so only time will tell. He is down but don’t count him out yet, global investors would be wise to remember how resilient Indian businessmen can be.</p>
                    <p>A case in point is when short sellers tried to squeeze late Dhirubhai Ambani, founder of India’s largest private sector company, Reliance Industries Limited.</p>
                    <p>After its IPO in 1977, Reliance’s share price steadily climbed upwards. In 1982, Reliance announced a rights issue of partly convertible debentures.</p>
                    <p>A cartel of bear operators were of the opinion that the management team of Reliance was artificially keeping the prices high, to ensure the rights issue was fully subscribed. They believed the share price was overvalued and started short selling shares of Reliance.</p>
                    <p>The selling pressure was intense causing the price to tumble quickly.</p>
                    <p>But then something strange happened. A buying spree began, a group of investors started buying shares and the price began moving upwards.</p>
                    <p>The bears lost the gamble and had to buy shares at a higher price to close their positions.</p>
                    <p>It was rumored that Dhirubhai Ambani himself had bought the shares from the bears when the price was low and sold it to them when the price was high.</p>   
                    <p>In business it’s critical the leader has the courage to face impossible situations and see the company through, and so the question remains - can Gautam Adani pull through?</p>

                    <p>Mar 22</p></br>
                    <p>Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest bank in the US, failed on March 10th, becoming the biggest bank to fail since Lehman Brothers in 2008.</p>
                    <p>One of the fallouts from the SVB’s collapse was the stablecoin USDC broke its one-to-one dollar peg. Its price plummeted to a historic low of 88 cents on the dollar. The market was jittery about the coin’s ~$3.3 billion deposit lying in Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
                    <p>We wonder if Circle, the operator behind USDC, would have been able to maintain the peg if the deposit in SVB was lost entirely? Or, if Circle could have taken any actions to mitigate the depegging event?</p>
                    <p>USDC is much more important than a mere stablecoin in the ecosystem (there are several more with USDT- Tether being the most reputable). Being the second largest stablecoin by market capitalization, and the largest with proven resources backing it, USDC is essential to the health of the Web3 economy.</p>
                    <p>The stablecoin business is unique, people park their dollars and don’t receive any interest on their deposits. Circle, on the other hand, earns interest on these deposits. So, why do people use stablecoins as they do?</p>
                    <p>For one, the confidence that they can easily and reliably exchange it 1-1 for USD. It allows investors and traders to easily move in and out of positions and hold their profits/capital in USDC. Removing the headache of managing the wide fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices while still participating in the crypto economy. This convenience has made stablecoins critical to the ecosystem and been instrumental in increasing how people participate in crypto ventures and the Web3 space.</p>
                    <p>To ensure that it always has liquidity, Circle holds the money invested into USDC, in cash and short-term US government debt. This allows it to process redemptions easily without taking on any undue risks.</p>
                    <p>Circle earned a massive windfall on its deposits as interest rates rose. In an interview in January 2023, Circle founder Jeremy Allaire said, “Monetization really scaled up in 2022.”</p>
                    <p>Let’s look how Circle generates revenues – Other than earning interest on the cash and short-term US government bonds backing USDC, Circle also makes money from its Transaction and Treasury Services (TTS). According to it’s 2021 presentation, Circle forecasted generating $40 million from managing the pool of money backing USDC as well as $65 million in transaction fees.</p>
                    <p>USDC’s market capitalization as of 16th March 2023, is ~$38 billion. In their statement on 14th March, they have disclosed “as part of our ongoing initiatives to strengthen the USDC reserve, we now hold the cash portion of the reserve at BNY Mellon, except for limited funds held at transaction banking partners in support of USDC minting and redemption. The majority of the reserve is invested in the Circle Reserve Fund, managed by BlackRock and custodied at BNYM, which is principally comprised of short dated U.S. Treasuries.”</p>
                    <p>However, investors fear was on a rampage, and after the sagas such as Terra-Luna and FTX/Alameda Research, they are tired of big announcements and lost funds. The run for the banks began.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the saga, Circle has maintained that it would defend the peg even if the ~$3.3 billion deposited in SVB was lost. It has ample reserves elsewhere and would make USDC holders whole using company funds or raising money from investors.</p>
                    <p>Prices recovered on Monday when the regulators stepped in with decisive action. While SVB had gone bust, the deposit holders’ capital was safe and would be made whole. This restored confidence in the coin and allowed it to recover it’s peg, one USDC could once again be converted to one US dollar.</p>
                    <p>Alas, damage has been done and confidence is low once more. Or to be more accurate, remains low since Q1 2022.</p>
                    <p>We are hopeful that this is the end of it, but we are confident we are yet to see the ripples that this is due to create. From regulators, from filling the void of SVB (and silvergate that shut down around the same time), and how investors’ confidence will take time to be restored in the form of coin value and participation in new projects in the ecosystem.</p>

                    <p>Growth in China’s mutual fund industry signals misaligned incentives</p>
                    <p>China’s mutual fund (MF) market has seen rapid growth in the past few years.</p>
                    <p>One of the reasons behind this burgeoning market, is a renewed push from MF distributors to get retail investors to invest as they collect fees when people buy, sell or simply hold their funds.</p>
                    <p>According to a report on China's fund investments published in October 2022, fees collected by MF distributors who are mainly banks reached 191-billion-yuan v/s 102-billion-yuan earned by fund managers, the people who actually manage the money.</p>
                    <p>Given the distributors have more firepower, the focus shifts to building new products and selling them to investors, instead of maximizing investor returns. This continuous rejig of investors’ portfolios forces the investor to pay more fees and focus on short-term market movements instead of selecting an investment based on fundamentals and letting it grow over a long period.</p>
                    <p>What could have been an entry vehicle for people to invest in the stock market is being mis-sold. Perhaps a combination of regulation, competition and investor education could align the incentives and level the playing field.</p>

                    Wouldn’t it be great if you could make money off your favorite song/artist?</p>
                    <p>Well, there is a start-up that aims to make that a reality.</br>
                    Chicago based Clouty™ has created an index, MUSIQ™ 500, that compiles the top 500 songs in the US based on streaming data.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>The goal is to develop music as an asset class which is uncorrelated to markets, by launching futures segmented by genres, artists and songs.</p>
                    <p>Using the index, investors can trade or owners of the music rights can hedge their risks, similar to how commodity traders such as Trafigura hedge volatile oil prices.</p>
                    <p>Buying music rights is hardly a new phenomenon, Michael Jackson bought portions of the Beatles catalogue in 1985 which later served as collateral for personal loans.</p>
                    <p>Clouty is capitalising on the investments made by private equity behemoths- Blackstone and KKR. In recent years investors, have invested upwards of $5 billion buying the rights of artists such as Whitney Houston, Leonard Cohen, Neil Diamond and Bruce Springsteen hoping to secure regular cash flows that are immune to economic downturns.</p>
                    <p>By converting Music into an asset class, Clouty hopes that investors who have spent heavily on music rights could also use futures to shield themselves against the risk of songs falling out of fashion.</p>
                    <p>As investments continue pouring into the music industry, the development of markets allowing investors to trade music rights in a secondary market is “an inevitability” according to David Umeh, CEO of Clouty. Another company in the music industry making waves is NUSIC. Adam Place, one of the founders of Nusic states the purpose is to ensure musicians get paid fairly for their art. By leveraging blockchain, smart contracts and automation that enables creators and rightsholders to claim sovereignty over their music.</p>

                    <p>The Rise of the Petrodollar and Cristiano Ronaldo</p>
                    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s move to Al-Nassr, a Saudi Arabian club makes him the highest-paid athlete in the world.</p>
                    <p>Getting Ronaldo onboard is a strategic play by Saudi Arabia to enhance its appeal to football lovers across the world. This comes on the heels of PIF, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, investing into Newcastle United in 2021.</p>
                    <p>Moves such as these are possible because of the wealth generated from years of oil exports. PIF’s assets amount to over of $600 billion.</p>
                    <p>The IMF forecasts that due to rising oil prices, the Middle East’s oil and gas producers are set to reap up to $1.3tn in additional revenue over the next four years. Much of it will flow to the Gulf countries, home to top crude exporter Saudi Arabia and the largest liquefied natural gas exporter Qatar.</p>
                    <p>Where does PIF allocate the funds to? Primarily Tech – Nintendo, Microsoft, Zoom, Alphabet to name a few.</p>
                    <p>This soaring wealth drives the moves of global finance as well,</p>
                    <p>In 2008, as the oil price soared to $147 a barrel, bankers and financiers were knocking on sovereign wealth fund’s doors seeking investments. Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Barclays were some high-profile companies bolstered by injections of Gulf petrodollars.</p>
                    <p>Who do you think will benefit from the rise of petrodollars this time around?</p>

                    <p>To talk about the past, we should look at the recent. As you know, to combat the effects of the pandemic and to promote growth, countries across the world launched massive stimulus programs. <a href="https://www.northerntrust.com/united-states/insights-research/2022/weekly-economic-commentary/more-money-supply-problems" target="_blank">Northern Trust</a> points out, “Since the COVID crisis, the money supply has grown by 40% in the U.S., 22% in the U.K. and 20% in the eurozone.”</p>
                    <p>This sudden influx of money into the system coupled with supply chain disruptions caused goods to become more expensive i.e., inflation to spike.</p>
                    <p>To control inflation and remove the excess liquidity from the monetary system, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates five times this year, up to the time these lines are written, and is expected to make further moves to tame inflation. Given the dollar dominance in export related trade, what happens in the U.S. affects every country.</p>
                    <p>The high returns of the S&P 500 of 2020 and 2021 have petered out and now markets are flashing warning signs that the global economy is teetering on a cliff’s edge!</p>
                    <p>To understand why boom times, inflation and recession seem to follow each other we should look to the past.</p>
                    <p>To a bubble that involves increasing money supply, hyperinflation, leading to recession and currency devaluation.</p>
                    <p>The year was 1715, France had a problem, it was massively in debt. It had fought a costly war; the War of Spanish Succession, lasting 13 years against Britain, Netherlands, and Austria. France along with Spain fought together to protect the power of the next Spanish King.</p>
                    <p>To finance the war, France issued war bonds, borrowing money from people by issuing debt securities, leading to unprecedented levels of debt. All to be repaid from government coffers.</p>
                    <p>John Law, a financial theorist, proposed a solution: permit a “General Bank” whose main purpose is to collect taxes and issue bank notes which would be exchangeable for coins. Thereby the bank took deposits of coins but issued loans and withdrawals in paper.</p>
                    <p>Once notes were commonplace, the bank could increase the notes supply while only holding coins worth a fraction of the value of all outstanding bank notes. Printing money without the backing of gold/silver coins. Aka <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp" target="_blank">fractional- reserve banking</a>.</p>
                    <p>The bank could then increase the money supply to encourage economic growth, thus increasing tax revenues and helping the government to pay off its debt. By the end of 1719, the total notes issued expanded from 200 million livres (the French currency of the period) to 1 billion livres, a 5x jump in just 4 years.</p>
                    <p>Seeing the success of General Bank, Law was granted a charter to establish the Mississippi Company. The company took over large portions of French overseas trade and obtained a monopoly on tobacco production.</p>
                    <p>Eventually in 1720, the Mississippi Company took over General Bank, thus taking over the rights to print money and collect taxes.</p>
                    <p>Speculation was rampant and encouraged in the company shares.</p>
                    <p>The increased money supply, combined with the fact that shares could be purchased with only 10% of the total share price needed for down payment and a vibrant secondary market, provided all the necessary ingredients needed for a bubble to form.</p>
                    <p>The share price surged ahead. Law seemed to have engineered a self-fulfilling belief that the price of the shares could only go up!</p>
                    <p>Soon after, the Company’s largest operation, became a scheme for the reduction of the government’s debt.</p>
                    <p>The essence of this scheme; an equity-debt swap. People must surrender government bonds to buy Mississippi shares. People surrendered debt which was yielding 4.5% for the hope of making a windfall capital gain on the shares.</p>
                    <p>The company lent the money raised from the share proceeds to the government, which used the loan to buy out its (government) debt from the company. The interest rate on the loan taken by the government was only 3%, thus in effect the burden of interest on the government had been substantially reduced from 4.5% to 3%.</p>
                    <p>But Law could only propagate a belief for a brief period and after poor financial decisions made by the company, the momentum on the share price started to flag. After a 25% decline in price, Law committed to making the General Bank buy back shares at a price significantly above the prevailing market price, and the shareholders overwhelmingly chose to take him up on the offer.</p>
                    <p>The company did not have enough liquid funds to buy back all the surrendered shares, Law once again increased the supply of bank notes, from 1.2 to 2.7 billion livres over the course of the next 3 months, creating hyperinflation.</p>
                    <p>At that point it was game over for the Law game - The French government’s ambitious efforts to reform its debt had comprehensively failed.</p>
                    <p>Because of failed policies, France experienced a severe recession. The currency had to be devalued. But the trust in the system had vanished resulting in the paper currency becoming worthless. Creditors doubted France’s ability to repay the loans and penalised the country with a high interest rate. The Mississippi bubble resulted in a serious handicap in future conflicts as the repayment of the debt looked dubious and the once burnt creditors became averse to purchasing government debt again.</p>
                    <p>A dramatic increase in money supply and then attempts to manipulate debt using various methods. Sound familiar? It seems that the echoes of history can be heard even today.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Fast Forward to Where the US Stands Today?</strong></h3>
                    <p>An excerpt from the <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/analysis-cbos-july-2022-long-term-budget-outlook" target="_blank">analysis</a> done by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget</p>
                    <p>“Under current law, debt will rise from an already massive 98 percent of GDP at the end of FY 2022 to 185 percent by 2052. The deficit, meanwhile, will total 11.1 percent of GDP in 2052 – higher than the 3.5 percent of GDP average seen over the past 50 years and higher than at any point in modern history outside of World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic. And interest costs will reach 7.2 percent of GDP by 2052, more than twice the prior record.”</p>
                    <p>…</p>
                    <p>“Ultimately, high debt levels will slow income and wage growth, increase interest payments on the national debt, place upward pressure on interest rates, reduce the fiscal space available to respond to an economic recession or other emergency, put an undue burden on future generations, and heighten the risk of a fiscal crisis. Policymakers should work today to get our long-term fiscal house in order.”</p>
                    <p>Basically, we have reached a breaking point, we used debt liberally in the past to fuel growth. But now the debt is becoming unsustainable, revenue is being used to service the debt and inflation is at an all-time high.</p>
                    <p>The circumstances which fueled the Mississippi bubble are present today. There is more money sloshing in the system than ever before, assets are being bought for the sole purpose of generating a profit meaning they possess little/no fundamental value and there exists the infrastructure to easily buy and sell assets limiting friction and reducing costs associated with the process.  </p>                 
                    <h3><strong>What does this uncertainty mean for investors?</strong></h3>
                    <p>During times of crisis or when one seems to be rapidly approaching it, it is best to refer to what the experts have to say.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-w-hennecke-457a6153/" target="_blank">Martin W. Hennecke</a>, Head of Asia Investment Advisory, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sjpasia/" target="_blank">St. James's Place – Asia </a> Wealth Management advises diversification across markets, sectors and asset types is essential to protect capital against adverse conditions.</p>
                    <p>“These may include different types of assets such as property, commodities, equities, inflation linked bonds etc. Furthermore, equities can protect from inflation in so far as they can pass on rising input costs to customers in the form of higher prices if they have got an edge in the market, the economy remains stable and inflation is broad based including wages as well”, says Martin.</p>                    
                    <p>“Given the uncertainties we are seeing globally with regards to interest rates, inflation, potential recession, geopolitics etc. I would caution investors to be free of debt, or at least to limit debt exposure, as much as possible, as volatility may persist, and the worst scenario is for investors to receive margin calls and potentially get stopped out of positions during crises at the worst possible times”, says Martin.</p>
                    <p>For risk seeking individuals, Martin suggests, “assets/markets which have sold off particularly deeply in recent times trading at low valuations from an equity (and/or currency perspective) should be considered to be included in portfolios, such as for example China and Japanese equities, although we would still highly recommend being diversified globally.</p>
                    <p>Investors nowadays also need to be conscious of the risk of ‘not investing’ given that we are in an environment of significantly negative real interest rates which implies an erosion of purchasing power of cash holdings over time.”</p>                    
                    <p>During uncertain times, steady hands guide the ship best. That is something we at Asia SGE specialize in.</p>

                    <p>Some Interplay between the public and private markets</p>
                    <p>Investors have been pulling their funds from Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, or BREIT at an alarming rate.</p>
                    <p>The clientele of the private trust are wealthy individuals, most of them holding leveraged positions in their portfolios. Given the fall in property prices and the negative stock market returns, investors are getting hit with margin calls.</p>
                    <p>BREIT’s success makes it vulnerable to investor redemptions. The trust delivered 9.3% total return this year, while US listed real estate trusts have declined ~20%.</p>
                    <p>Since the fund repurchases redemption requests at their most recent quarter’s net asset value, it became a rare asset investor looking to raise cash could sell at annual highs.</p>        
                    <p>US investors began submitting requests to trim parts of their holdings, realising their gains and offsetting taxes with losses on other assets. Blackstone was forced to limit withdrawals, and at the hint of trouble investor demand to pull their money from the fund may intensify.</p>
                    <p>This case shows the public and private markets don’t move in tandem. Even a good fund in a bad market needs to have strong liquidity buffers to stabilise itself. And a bad fund in a good market can generate above market returns. (Softbank😊)</p>

          details: `
                    <p>Oct 11</p></br> 
                    <p>How to value private debt?</p>
                    <p>John Maynard Keynes, the renowned economist said “If you owe your bank a hundred pounds, you have a problem. But if you owe your bank a million pounds, it has.”</p>
                    <p>A few years ago, The Economist added “If you owe your bank a billion pounds, everybody has a problem”.</p>
                    <p>This nexus can be seen playing out between H2O an asset management company and Lars Windhorst a German financier.</p>   
                    <p>In 2018, H2O’s funds were among Europe’s best-performing alternative funds, one strategy returned an impressive net 32.9%. Given the astounding returns, H2O’s assets under management increased ten-fold in six years from €3bn in 2013 to €30bn in 2019.</p>
                    <p>However, these returns and growth masked something deeper that was amiss. As per Financial Times, H2O held more than €1.4bn in bonds, issued by financial vehicles linked to Mr Windhorst across six of H2O’s funds.</p>
                    <p>These bonds are illiquid, and H2O’s funds are mandated to allow retail investors to withdraw their money daily. Matching short term obligations to long term repayments has always been a risky business. One particular investment, Sapinda Invest bond failed to pay its coupons on time.</p>
                    <p>Given the riskiness of the investment, in 2016, PWC, the auditor of H2O’s funds, issued a qualification relating to Sapinda Invest bond. The issue- the asset manager used a price contributed by an intermediary and the quotes received by the audit firm from other brokers were vastly different.</p>
                    <p>The discrepancy may have represented more than 1% of the net assets of one of H2O’s funds.</p>                      
                    <p>Moreover, the price reflected in the balance sheet did not factor in the illiquidity cost. The next year H2O removed the investment from the balance sheet. By rolling over the investment from Sapinda Invest bond into another one of bonds related to Mr Windhorst entities. In 2020, the French market regulator suspended a series of H2O funds because of their “significant exposure” to illiquid debt, Leading to an uncertain future for the retail investors who trusted H2O to protect their savings.</p>
                    <p>The point is, valuing private debt is subjective. It is possible to manufacture a win-win situation for the bond issuer and the asset manager while the retail investors are left in the dust waiting for their monies to be repaid.</p>
                    <p>Asia SGE can provide you with the guidance on dealing with such situations and transactions</p>

          title: "About Green Bonds and Greenwashing",
          details: `
                    <p>Sep 13</p></br>
                    <p>Hong Kong leads the way for Green Bond Issuances. But greenwashing fears rise.</p>
                    <p>Green bonds have become increasingly popular over the last few years as a way of raising funds for environmentally friendly projects.</p>
                    <p>As a major global financial centre, Hong Kong has been leading the way in issuing and funding these bonds.</p>
                    <p>But fears continue to abound whether the funds for projects are being used responsibly or is the green label being used solely for marketing purposes to hoodwink investors.</p>   
                    <h3><strong>What are green bonds?</strong></h3>                    
                    <p>Green bonds work like traditional bonds with one key difference: the money raised from investors is used exclusively to finance projects that will have a positive environmental impact. These bonds help fund renewable energy projects such as wind, solar and hydro, recycling efforts, clean transportation, green buildings, and sustainable forestry.</p>
                    <p>Given the climate crises we face and our dependence on fossil fuels for energy, it is the need of the hour that we fund projects that don’t leave an outsized imprint on the environment. Initiatives such as the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals are holding countries accountable for their greenhouse gas emissions, which has deepened political resolve for green financing.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Are green bonds more expensive than traditional bonds?</strong></h3>                       
                    <p>The price of a green bond is similar to that of a traditional bond. The bonus feature of a green bond is the positive impact the proposed project will have on the environment.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Can retail investors purchase green bonds?</strong></h3>      
                    <p>Usually, green bonds are sold to large organizations such as institutional investors, pension funds, asset managers etc. Going against the norm, in 2022, the Hong Kong SAR government issued bonds worth HKD 20 billion (USD 2.55 billion) for retail investors. Globally, this is the biggest retail green bond issuance.</p>
                    <p>The three-year bond carries twice-yearly interest payments tied to inflation, with a guaranteed minimum annual interest rate of 2.5%. The funds raised will go towards resource-recycling projects and the construction of environmentally friendly buildings.</p>     
                    <p>The floor rate of 2.5% is higher than the fixed deposit rate of ~1%. With the principal guaranteed by the HKSAR government, the bond offers stable and attractive returns.</p>
                    <p>Seeing the investor demand, the government plans on issuing HKD 10 billion of retail green bonds in the next financial year.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, as individuals we can invest in exchange-traded funds and mutual funds to gain exposure to green bonds, such as Calvert Green Bond Fund or iShares USD Green Bond ETF.</p>   
                    <p>By investing in green bonds, investors can finance eco-friendly projects while earning competitive returns. Earlier, funding for green projects was the domain of governments and institutions with buying power. </p>
                    <h3><strong>Institutional Investors Perception of Green Bonds</strong></h3>                     
                    <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, believes the transition to net zero emissions presents a "historic investment opportunity." In his letter to CEO’s he stated, “Few things will impact capital allocation decisions – and thereby the long-term value of your company – more than how effectively you navigate the global energy transition in the years ahead.</p>
                    <p>It’s been two years since I wrote that climate risk is investment risk.”</p>
                    <p>In investing in this space, BlackRock’s appetite outpaces other investors. At the end of 2021, BlackRock reported that it has USD 10 trillion of assets under management, including USD 16 billion in green bonds. Even though BlackRock’s investment in green bonds constitutes a small part of its overall portfolio, it signals to the market participants its intention to pursue sustainable investments.  </p>
                    <p>Ultimately, green bonds must compete in returns with traditional bonds to be considered for purchase by investors. Eventually for issuers, going green comes at a cost, the cost of setting up filters so that carbon dioxide is not released into the air or treating the pollutants and not releasing them as is into the water. It’s a cost and benefit analysis.</p>  
                    <p>With a nudge from activists and evidence in the form of wildfires, climate change and flooding the bond market is changing. It’s situations like this when markets are undergoing a tectonic shift that one can see investment opportunities emerge.</p>
                    <h3><strong>How big is the global green bond market?</strong></h3>    
                    <p>The global green bond market has crossed USD 1 trillion, in cumulative issuance in December 2020. This is a big milestone, though it’s still just a niche in the overall global bond market, which is estimated to be USD 130 trillion. With a continued focus on climate friendly policies and ESG investing the market for green bonds will continue to grow.</p>
                    <h3><strong>How is Hong Kong leading the way for green bonds?</strong></h3>  
                    <p>In 2021, Climate Bonds Initiative identified USD 10.4 billion worth of green bonds and loans originating from Hong Kong. This represents the highest volume on record, with four times YoY growth. The depth of the market results in easy access to capital for the issuers, stimulating more private funding for sustainable projects in the region.</p>   
                    <p>Some notable deals include, MTR Corporation raising USD 192 million to finance improvements that will aid in decarbonization of Hong Kong’s transport sector. China Development Bank (Hong Kong Branch) issuing a 3-year, USD 500 million bond with proceeds earmarked for renewable energy and low-carbon transport.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Is “greenwashing” something to be concerned about?</strong></h3>  
                    <p>The rapid expansion of the green bond market has posed a problem of “greenwashing”- wherein companies make exaggerated or false environmental claims to help them raise funds from investors.</p>
                    <p>For example, in 2022 the Airport Authority Hong Kong raised USD 1 billion via a green bond tranche to help fund the development of a third runway. Environmental campaigners complain the project poses a danger to Chinese white dolphins that are already threatened with extinction. In addition, the project will result in increasing carbon emissions due to an increase in air traffic.</p>
                    <p>The concerns around “#greenwashing” emerge due to the lack of a global standard for the issuance of these bonds. Green bonds are issued under a variety of guidelines developed by trade bodies such as the International Capital Markets Association, Climate Bonds Initiative, big banks, or the country’s own framework. This results in a patchwork of voluntary standards which permits misuse of the “green” label.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, a lack of transparency, traceability and accountability on how the Green Bond funds are being spent, as well as the continual monitoring and verification of the positive environmental impact as promised throughout the lifetime of the Green Bond remains a challenge and a risk to investors, regulators and issuers. The data, technology and processes required to establish and maintain integrity, validity and trust on Green Bonds are still being developed and over time, should address concerns regarding greenwashing.</p>                                          
                    <p>In the meantime, as investors, we have to be vigilant where funds will be invested and demand for accountability from our government and corporates.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>  
                    <p>As an emerging asset class that’s quickly gaining popularity, green bonds represent a great option for investors that want to make an impact while still generating returns. However, concerns around greenwashing remain and all bonds should be evaluated carefully before investing in them.</p>
